## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Simple Scan
```bash
python web_security_scanner.py https://example.com
```

#### Scan with Authentication
```bash
python web_security_scanner.py https://example.com --username admin --password password123
```

#### Advanced Scanner
```bash
python advanced_scanner.py https://example.com --username admin --password password123
```

### Command Line Options

#### Basic Scanner
```bash
python web_security_scanner.py [URL] [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --username USERNAME    Username for authentication
  --password PASSWORD    Password for authentication
  --threads THREADS      Maximum number of threads (default: 5)
```

#### Advanced Scanner
```bash
python advanced_scanner.py [URL] [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --username USERNAME    Username for authentication
  --password PASSWORD    Password for authentication
  --config CONFIG        Configuration file path (default: config.yaml)
```

### Configuration

The scanner uses a YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`) for customizable settings:

```yaml
scanner:
  max_threads: 5
  request_delay: 1.0
  timeout: 30

payloads:
  xss:
    - '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'
  sql_injection:
    - "' OR '1'='1"
```

## üìä Output and Reports

### Console Output
The scanner provides real-time feedback during execution:
```
Starting security scan of: https://example.com
Testing XSS on: https://example.com/login
Testing SQL Injection on: https://example.com/search
XSS vulnerability found: <script>alert("XSS")</script>
```

### Generated Reports

#### JSON Report
Comprehensive vulnerability data in machine-readable format:
```json
{
  "scan_info": {
    "target_url": "https://example.com",
    "scan_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "total_vulnerabilities": 3
  },
  "vulnerabilities": [...]
}
```

#### HTML Report
Professional, formatted report for stakeholders:
- Color-coded risk levels
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Mitigation recommendations
- Executive summary

#### CSV Report
Spreadsheet-friendly format for analysis:
- Vulnerability type
- Risk level
- Affected URL
- Description
- Mitigation steps

### Log Files
- Detailed execution logs
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Timestamped activities

## üîß Customization

### Adding Custom Payloads

Edit `config.yaml` to add your own testing payloads:

```yaml
payloads:
  custom_test:
    - "your_custom_payload_here"
    - "another_test_case"
```

### Modifying Test Parameters

Adjust scanning behavior in the configuration:

```yaml
scanner:
  max_threads: 10        # Increase for faster scanning
  request_delay: 0.5     # Reduce for aggressive testing
  timeout: 60            # Increase for slow servers
```

### Extending Functionality

The modular design allows easy addition of new test types:

```python
def test_custom_vulnerability(self, url, form_data=None):
    """Test for custom vulnerability type"""
    # Your custom testing logic here
    pass
```

## üö® Responsible Usage Guidelines

### Before Scanning
1. **Obtain Written Permission** from website owner
2. **Define Scope** of testing activities
3. **Set Expectations** for testing schedule
4. **Establish Communication** channels

### During Scanning
1. **Monitor Performance** of target systems
2. **Respect Rate Limits** to avoid disruption
3. **Document All Activities** for reporting
4. **Stop Immediately** if issues arise

### After Scanning
1. **Generate Comprehensive Report** with findings
2. **Prioritize Vulnerabilities** by risk level
3. **Provide Clear Mitigation** recommendations
4. **Follow Up** on critical issues

```

#### Rate Limiting
```bash
Error: 429 Too Many Requests
Solution: Increase delays between requests
```

### Debug Mode
